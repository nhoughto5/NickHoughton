            What did they need?

            The group needed something colorful and attractive to match their music and persona. They wanted something cheap that didn't break their
            already stretched budget but wit enough tid-bits to look cool and keep their fans up to date.

            How did I help them?

            I began by getting a feel for them as a group. Wading through their music and art gave me a great sense of what they consider important and what keeps
            bringing their fans back. Knowing that none of them were particularily tech-savy I built them an easy to use admin page where they can upload images, and promote upcoming gigs.

            What did I use?

            For this project I used <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> to build a simple full stack system to manage and store their shows.
            The front end was built using vanilla javascript with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> CSS.
