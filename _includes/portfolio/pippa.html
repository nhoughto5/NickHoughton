            Dr. Phillippa Houghton is an avid medical blogger.
            She was looking for a clean and stylish medium for her online journal.

            Dr. R sent me a list of medical blogs she is a fan of.
            She was keen to emulate the style and flow of popular sites while maintaining a her own design.
            We worked together over several weeks via Skype meetings to ensure the end design reflected her desires.

            For this project I used the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static website framework.
            The benefit of Jekyll is it's quick and powerful development cycle which allowed me to return a working prototype rapidly.
            The static nature however required a supplement for the lack of a back-end.
            I came across the <a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contenful</a> content management system.
            This, combined with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> overcame the need of costly server development.
