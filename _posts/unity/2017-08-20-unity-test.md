For those who are yet to come across [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), it is one of, if not, the greatest online education website out there. In particular, their technical courses are many; most are excellent. I was keen to get some in depth experience with [Unity 5](https://unity3d.com/) so I went shopping. 
I came across a fantastic and lengthy course published by the [game institue](https://www.gameinstitute.com/) called [Build Your Own First Person Shooter Survival Game in Unity](https://www.udemy.com/build-your-own-first-person-shooter-survival-game-in-unity/). I scored this one for a meagre $10 USD.

This course boasts 40 hours of material.... well, yeah... There is 40 hours of video instruction but that does not mean it takes 40 hours to complete. Assuming you are taking it seriously and following along in Unity, it takes quite a while longer than 40 hours to get through. Each video is dense with rich material. I constantly had to stop to fix mistakes or rewatch to make sure that I kept up.

Another excellent reason to look into this course is that the material happens to align really well with the [Unity certification courseware](https://certification.unity.com/courseware). For anyone considering getting their certification, this would be an excellent extra credit homework assignment!
